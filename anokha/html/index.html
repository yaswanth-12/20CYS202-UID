The event throws open opportunities for students from all disciplines to challenge themselves and foster the “Can Do” attitude.

It was plastic-free and eco-friendly Anokha – an initiative that will become a tradition!!”, Dr. Sasangan Ramanathan, Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
